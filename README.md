# Url Shortner

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web that enables the Uniform Resource Locator to be made considerably shorter and still direct to the desired page. This is done by using a redirect path to a web page that has a long URL.

The project is developed using Django for backend and HTML and CSS for frontend. 

## Installation

Create a virtual environment to install the dependent packages. You can use whatever method you like to create your own environment.

3) Open the terminal in the directory where the file ```manage.py``` is stored. Then type ```python manage.py runserver``` and press enter.

## Usage
When the user enters the link, a short link will appear. Use clipboard emote to copy the link. The link will redirect you to the original link.
